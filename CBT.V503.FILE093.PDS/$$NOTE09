Attached is a ZIP file containing PDSLOAD.ASM, as downloaded in
binary using IND$FILE. In addition to the member name
verification, I fixed a couple of other things; e.g., relying on
SDB doesn't help turnkey-MVS users very much. As a minor benefit
you get the TRENT macro and sample uses.

I went through an OFFLOAD/PDSLOAD/COMPARE cycle, and found no
errors, except that OFFLOAD used a block size of 3120 on a 3350.
I'll look at that when I get a chance.

Note to readers from Sam Golob (Feb. 5, 2012)

For now, this version of PDSLOAD will be called PDSLOADN in File
093.  It is a bit too different from the last PDSLOAD version
which is member PDSLOADW, and it should be tested very thoroughly
before it becomes eligible to become the "default PDSLOAD source".

Of course anyone is welcome to try and test member PDSLOADN.
It's just that the PDSLOAD program is so pervasive in the CBT
Tape collection that I don't want to "rock the boat" and change
it to this version until it is thoroughly tested.

The main problem dealt with in PDSLOAD is that it checks member
names for "validity" before it loads a new pds member with that name.
I took a vote among two people:  Greg Price said to eliminate the
validity check for member names altogether.  Gerhard Postpischil
said to keep it in.  Gerhard was willing to put his money where
his mouth is, so he programmed a new version of PDSLOAD, here
presented as member PDSLOADW.

Gerhard's new version has options.  Default is to eliminate the
validity check.  Two other options are to either check the name
in a limited manner, or check the name in a stricter manner.

   PARM='NAME=ASIS'   BYPASS ALL CHECKS  (default)
        'NAME=CHECK'  ALLOW ALL PRINTABLE CHARACTERS
                      (EXCEPT COMMA) USING CODEPAGE 037
        'NAME=IBM'    ENFORCE STRICT IBM JCL STANDARDS

Sincerely,  Sam Golob
