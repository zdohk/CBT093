Note on LISTPDS and 8-character ISPF userids.

Seems that IBM has finally started to be serious about 8-character
userids.  I would think that it is difficult to implement them for
TSO userids, because of the structure of SYS1.UADS and the PSCB
control block.  But I suppose the direction is finally going, where
RACF-defined userids will be up to 8 bytes, whereas UADS-defined
userids will have to remain at 7 bytes.  (This is my guess - 02/2017)

Anyway, the time seems to have arrived when ISPF userids for pds
members (which are in the ISPF stats for the member) are allowed to
be 8-bytes long.  So we (the user-tool writing community) must fix
LISTPDS, OFFLOAD, and PDSLOAD to accommodate this.

We have produced fixes for all of these programs, but I am not sure
they are ready for prime-time just yet.  The LISTPDS fix was only one
line.  So I think it is at least as good as the old version, and I am
putting it into "production" on Files 093 (source), 035, and 135
(load).

OFFLOAD was almost as simple a fix.  So that one will come next.

PDSLOAD required much more work, from me, from Greg Price, and from
its original author.  It seems to work pretty well as it is now, and
with a little bit more testing, I'll probably put it into production
soon, as well.  If you see an ISPF "modified date" of 2017, it will be
the new version, most probably.  So I won't have to update this member
when that version of PDSLOAD will be put into "production" too.

Please report any problems here.  We'll do the best we can to fix them,
without a formal promise to do so.  (We try....)  All disclaimers apply.
