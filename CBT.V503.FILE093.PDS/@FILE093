//***FILE 093 Contains a system to sequentialize a PDS (any         *   FILE 093

//*           Gerhard Postpischil has submitted a new version       *   FILE 093

//*           as follows:  PDSLOOLD, the oldest version, followed   *   FILE 093
//*           by PDSLOAD1 thru PDSLOAD9 in date order.  PDSLOADW    *   FILE 093
//*           is newer than all of them.  I guess that I'll         *   FILE 093

//*       LRECL for both fixed-length and variable-length           *   FILE 093
//*       records.  The LRECL of the input sequential data set      *   FILE 093
//*       can but need not match the LRECL of the output            *   FILE 093

//*       When the output PDS has fixed-length records, the input   *   FILE 093
//*       file may have fixed-length or variable-length records.    *   FILE 093
//*       (Text files transferred from PCs often go to variable-    *   FILE 093

//*       PARM=NEW is used to specify that, like IEBUPDTE, the      *   FILE 093
//*       input control+data stream is to be loaded from SYSIN,     *   FILE 093
//*       instead of SYSUT1.  In any event, if an OPEN for SYSUT1   *   FILE 093
//*       does not open successfully (and no abend occurs) the      *   FILE 093
//*       OPEN is retried with SYSIN as the DDname.                 *   FILE 093
//*                                                                 *   FILE 093
//*       PARM=SPF can still be used to generate ISPF               *   FILE 093
//*       "statistics".  SSI information will be lost when this     *   FILE 093
//*       is selected.  The "userid" of generated stats is          *   FILE 093

//*       John Kalinich's Y2K windowing fix allows for 2-digit      *   FILE 093
//*       years below 66 to be deemed to belong to the 21st         *   FILE 093
//*       century.  This is necessary because the PDSLOAD stats     *   FILE 093
//*       format on the ./ ADD statement only allows for 2-digit    *   FILE 093
//*       years.  (Generated stats did not have a Y2K bug.)         *   FILE 093
//*                                                                 *   FILE 093
//*       The SPF stats current record count will always be set     *   FILE 093
//*       from the record count processed by PDSLOAD, even when     *   FILE 093
//*       this differs from the data supplied on a ./ ADD card.     *   FILE 093
//*       Other data will not be overridden.  Apart from the        *   FILE 093
//*       userid, supplied stats are now verified to consist of     *   FILE 093
//*       numeric characters.                                       *   FILE 093
//*                                                                 *   FILE 093
//*       The asterisk (*), question mark (?) and percent sign      *   FILE 093
//*       (%) are now treated as generic character placeholders     *   FILE 093
//*       for member selection.  The three mask characters          *   FILE 093
//*       function identically, and cause a match for the           *   FILE 093
//*       corresponding byte position of the member name.  Thus,    *   FILE 093
//*       S(ABC****X) will select all members beginning with        *   FILE 093
//*       'ABC' and ending in 'X' in the eighth byte, and S(****)   *   FILE 093
//*       will select all members with names no longer than four    *   FILE 093
//*       non-blank characters.                                     *   FILE 093

//*       The IBM OS utility DDname override parameter can now be   *   FILE 093
//*       used by PDSLOAD.  The SYSIN, SYSPRINT and SYSUT2          *   FILE 093
//*       "slots" are relevant.  (This was done to facilitate       *   FILE 093
//*       dynamic invocation from the REVIEW TSO command.)  See     *   FILE 093
//*       the leading comments in the source code for more          *   FILE 093

//*     Greg Price and Gerhard Postpischil have the same initials.  *   FILE 093
//*     Therefore, Greg refers to this "update team" as TEAM-GP.    *   FILE 093

//*     One issue dealt with in PDSLOAD is that it checks           *   FILE 093
//*     member names for "validity" before it loads a new pds       *   FILE 093
//*     member with that name.  I took a vote among two people:     *   FILE 093
//*     Greg Price said to eliminate the validity check for         *   FILE 093
//*     member names altogether.  Gerhard Postpischil said to       *   FILE 093
//*     keep it in.  Gerhard was willing to put his money where     *   FILE 093
//*     his mouth is, so he programmed a new version of PDSLOAD,    *   FILE 093
//*     now presented as member PDSLOADW.                           *   FILE 093

//*     Gerhard's new version has options.  Default is to           *   FILE 093
//*     eliminate the validity check.  Two other options are to     *   FILE 093
//*     either check the name in a limited manner, or check the     *   FILE 093
