We are addressing a situation with the PDSLOAD member restore program.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
PDSLOAD contains member name validity checks.
This means that in an ./ADD NAME=mmmmmmmm card, if the member name
mmmmmmmm is deemed "invalid", then that member does not get restored.
---------------------------------------------------------------------

OFFLOAD and LISTPDS do not check the validity of member names.

This situation creates a problem with restoring certain member names
from the CBT Tape.

The CBT Tape (actual tape image) contains all members, as can be seen
from a TAPEMAP of it.  But they do not all get restored when you
reload the pds'es from the tape, using PDSLOAD, if the member contains
an "invalid character".  The problem character that we saw, was the
X'C0' or "open curly bracket".

Problem was addressed as follows:

  1.  X'C0' was made "valid" in the ALPHANUM translate table.

  2.  A label BYPVALID was created in the source, after label
        SIMPLE.  A commented instruction to branch to BYPVALID
        can be uncommented, to get rid of this member validity
        check altogether, if you do not want to have any member
        validity check at all.  (Didn't uncomment in "production"
        source yet.  So we still have the validity check for now.)
