Note about the //SYSUPLOG DD file.

Versions of PDSLOADW, OFFLOADW, and LISTPDS which do this processing
are marked as VERSION 10.0 or above.

In the report you will see:   (note the V10.0 string in the title)

ADS -- OFFLOAD - PDS OFFLOADING PROGRAM - V10.0

       and

--- PDSLOAD --- PDS MEMBER RELOAD UTILITY --- V10.0


Explanation of processing......

PDSLOADW creates a pds from a sequentialized pds, that was created
by either IEBUPDTE, LISTPDS, or OFFLOADW.  If a MEMBER of the
original pds was ITSELF an unloaded pds, then all its IEBUPDTE
control cards, prefaced by the string "./" in column 1, were changed
to string "><" so they would not be interpreted as control cards upon
reload of the original pds.

However, if the original pds INITIALLY contained a record with "><"
string in column 1, this would be changed to "./" by PDSLOADW
erroneously.  In order for that not to happen, such original records
are logged in a log file.

The log file is pointed to by DD name //SYSUPLOG, which can be either
a sequential FB-80 dataset or a pds member with FB-80.

If you include a //SYSUPLOG DD card in the LISTPDS or OFFLOADW execution
JCL, then the log file will be produced.

If you include a //SYSUPLOG DD card in the PDSLOADW execution JCL,
then all "><" cards in that file, which correspond to member cards
in the sequential file to be loaded, will not be changed so their
first two characters would become "./" which would create an error.

When using PDSLOADW to reload a pds from a sequentialized PS file
(that originally was a pds), and if you want to ensure data integrity,
please include the SYSUPLOG file that was originally used to create
the sequentialized version of the file.  If there were never originally
any "><" characters in columns 1 and 2 of the original file, then you
don't need the SYSUPLOG file.  It will be empty.
