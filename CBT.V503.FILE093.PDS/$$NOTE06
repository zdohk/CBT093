Hi Sam,

Hope you and Hindy are well.

Please find attached a zip of an xmit of an updated PDSLOADW
intended for CBT file 93.

This version from "Team GP" contains a few little enhancements.

Gerhard's changes - chiefly done circa 2006 - add an extra parm
called CTL where CTL(xy) allows the conversion of the UPDTE
characters (such as ><) to characters xy (in this example)
instead of the usual ./ thus allowing an extra level of
substitution for the IEBUPDTE-like control statement code.

Gerhard's changes also removed the restriction that the parms
must be in a certain order - they can now be supplied in any order.
(Hooray!)

In 2008 I added a SYNAD exit for the output PDS so that an I/O
error message is issued to provide more details in such a case.

And 2009 changes ensure that an alias is not created without
its real member being loaded (thus preventing the creation of
an invalid directory entry), as well as adding support for variable-
length output from fixed-length input (which also triggers the
truncation of trailing blanks).

This source file can be assembled with IFOX00, and is good for
all MVS levels ever (well, 3.8 and later for sure, anyway).

Cheers,
Greg
