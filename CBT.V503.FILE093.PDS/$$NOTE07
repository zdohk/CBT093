Hi Gang,

Here's my stab at updates for CBT file 93.

Changed members are PDSLOADW and OFFLOADW, with a view
to handling extended ISPF stats.
   -------- -------- ---- -----
They can be assembled by IFOX00.  OFFLOADW requires macros
from CBT file 93 while PDSLOADW does not.

The intermediate sequential data set (in an OFFLOAD+PDSLOAD
cycle) now has more data in the IEBUPDTE statement comment
area.

OFFLOAD now puts the 2 seconds digits in columns 70 and 71,
and places high-order digits in columns 73 to 80 if the offloaded
member had extended stats.  Note that the digits in columns 73
to 80 may be 8 zeros if the various counters are all less than
99,999.  All the counters may be less than 65,535 even if
the member has extended stats.

The seconds digits in the ./ ADD statement will be set to zero
by OFFLOAD if they are not decimal or outside the 00-59 range,
which they can be if the stats were constructed by a pre-0909
version of PDSLOAD and the member was loaded after a
member which had an SSI setting (residual data problem).

IEBUPDTE will treat a non-blank in column 72 as a
continuation marker for ./ statements, so that column is
left blank.

PDSLOAD parsing requires a blank (or comma) between the
userid and seconds, and seconds and high-order digits if
present.  Note that the ISPF stats userid can never be longer
than 7 characters.  Original stats require 3 blanks after the
userid. Extended stats require 1 blank after the userid.

If there is a data item after the userid and it is not 2 bytes
of EBCDIC decimal digits in the 00->59 range then PDSLOAD
will end parsing of the record.

To get the 8 high-order digits processed the 2-digit seconds
must be present before the 8 high-order digits.  High-order
digits are only processed if all 8 are present in a single string.

Of the 8 contiguous high-order counter digits:
first 3 ==> current count
next 3 ==> initial count
last 2 ==> modified count

These digits are prefixed to the 5 digits supplied by the old
fields of the respective counters.  It does not give full
(2**32)-1 coverage, but it should do for most data produced
by ISPF Edit sessions.

Now that seconds are handled, an OFFLOAD+PDSLOAD cycle
should mean that the old and new PDSs should compare
equal in an IEBCOMPR
 COMPARE TYPORG=PO
compare, (which compares both directory entry user data and
member contents) assuming members have either no userdata,
SSI userdata or ISPF stats userdata.  (IEBCOMPR will give
COND CODE 0000 if SYSUT1 and SYSUT2 compare equal.)

Cheers,
Greg
