I just found a very embarrassing error in PDSLOAD.

Sequence 06300000 has LH R0,80 when it should be LA R0,80 (so why
did it ever work?)

Note:  Corrected by Sam Golob in source on File 093, and in the
       $PDSLOAD member object decks in various files on the CBT
       tape, as best I can.  Also in File 035 and File 135.
       Assembled location is +462.  The instruction should read:
       4100 0050    and NOT    4800 0050, so you can zap the
       load module as well, if that is the version of PDSLOAD
       which you are running.
